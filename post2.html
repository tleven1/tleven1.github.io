      <h2><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/mind/#/"> The Wired Mind<a></h2>
      <p> Why I chose the website The Wired Mind was because of its unique way of navigating the website.  In the center of the website there is an illustrated brain that different stems come out of, and each stem represents a different category.  Aside from the fact that the stems move around once you click on one it become bigger and the other categories look more faded.<p>
      <p>Also on this website the illustrated brain has different mechanical wheels that move around to make it look like a functional brain that is thinking.  The design aspect and typography for this website is both creative and entertaining. This is a great way to grasp the viewers attention and make them interested to keep using the site. Lastly the face beneath the brain looks like it was cut out from a magazine and pasted on to give it a fun look.<p>
