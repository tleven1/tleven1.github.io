      <p>This website has an amazing illustrations as well as great graphics which makes this site both amusing and successful. When you first enter the site you notice its variety of color and how they set up the sight. I choose this site because I love they layout and structure of the site which is something I have not yet looked into. The navigation is easy to follow for any age and the mouse it what controls the entire site.<p>  
	  <p>The website its self seems to be meant people of all ages and is very simple to understand. I love the illustrations  and graphics because it makes the page more exciting and fun to look at. I love how it scrolls down to continue to read the text whether then side by side.<p>
