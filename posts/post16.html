      <p>This website has a unique navigation system as well as being very entertaining. When you first you quickly notices to motion pictures being used as the background. Its beautiful graphics and pictures is what catches the viewers eye.<p>  
	  <p>The website contains a slideshow effect as well which makes it easy to use for all ages. I love there are a wide variety of colors and illustrations because it makes the page more exciting. I can see myself using similar features for future projects because of how engaging the site is.<p>
