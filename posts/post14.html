      <h2><a href="http://88and90lex.com/neighborhood"> The Neighborhood<a></h2>
      <p>This website has amazing navigation as well as being very organized. When you first enter the site its as if the site comes alive following a time line of different neighborhoods in different time periods. The navigation is easy to follow for any age and its moving slides make it more unique.<p>  
	  <p>The website contains facts as well as graphic design elements which is what drew my eye towards it. I love there are a wide variety of colors and illustrations because it makes the page more exciting. I can see my self using similar features for future projects because of how engaging the site is.<p>
