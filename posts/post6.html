      <p>This website has illustrations as well as a fun interactive page which makes this site both entertaining and unique. When you first enter the home page the first thing you notice is the imagery that slowly starts to swipe into the page. There is a scroll down navigation and once you scroll the website images come to life by falling apart as you scroll down. The navigation seems simple but complex at the same time and is entirely based on the graphics on the site.<p>  
	  <p>The website its self has amazing graphics that the imagery looks clear and not pixilated. I love the interactions the viewer has within the webpage and that it has a fun feel rather then a stiff webpage. This website does a great job grasping the viewers attention and letting them surf the site which is why I choose it.<p>
