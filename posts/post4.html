      <p>This website has amazing graphics as well as moving images which makes this site both entertaining and successful. When you first enter the site the loading symbol is a bouncing basketball which is innovative and a good fit for the websites theme. The navigation is easy to follow for any age and it moving slides make it more unique.<p>  
	  <p>The website its self provides facts based on statistics and how you answer each of the following questions. I love there are a wide variety of colors and illustrations because it makes the page more exciting. Each loading symbol is different from one another and the pages are different as well.<p>
