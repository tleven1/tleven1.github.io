      <p>This website has an easy navigation which makes it enjoyable to look at and use the content. When you first enter the site the home page has a images which show you what to expect when looking at the site as well as different categories to view.  Depending on what category you click on it your experience with this website altars. The navigation seems rather simple and is entirely based on how you click the mouse and where you hover over.<p>  
	  <p>The website is meant for shopping and the navigation gives that away. You can clearly see the shopping cart and they put the important material at the top og the page. This website does a great job grasping the viewers attention and letting them surf the site which is why I choose it.<p>
