      <h2><a href="http://cyclemon.com"> Cyclemon<a></h2>
      <p> Why I choose the website Cyclemon is because of its amazing graphic designs and its cool navigation.  When you first enter the website you see a mechanical wheel loading the page as it turns and spins.  The entire website requires you to continue scrolling downward which is different then other sites.  As you scroll downward the image of the bike altars into another bike as well as the background. <p>
      <p>I would love to learn how to use this navigational tool in future projects of mine or just to know in the future.  The website I illustrated beautifully which makes the viewer engaged in the content.  When I reached the bottom of the website it made me upset that there were not any more images to continue seeing.  They did an amazing job with this site. <p>
