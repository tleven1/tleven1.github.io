      <h2><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mlew15/19-websites-to-waste-time-on-right-now-h0se#.jqLeYywGz">Buzz Feed<a></h2>
     
      <p> I choose Buzz Feed as my website because aside from it being very entertaining I love its simplistic and comical designs.  The way that this website is setup is in categories which makes it easier for the viewer to follow.  People create quizzes, videos, pictures plus more and send it to this website. People from around the world can choose from the categories and view what appeals to them.<p>
      <p>The structure and or layout of the website is what interests me the most.  Once you have selected a category it provides a list of options appears which you can choose from.  Next to each of the options there is a symbol, which represents the category you are in.  Buzz feed does an amazing job of using different typefaces and colors to intrigue the viewer as well.<p>
