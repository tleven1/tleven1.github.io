      <p>This website has slideshows as well as a fun interactive page which makes this site both entertaining and unique. When you first enter the site the home page the first thing you notice is the giant image and moves depending on the way you move ur mouse. There is a scroll down navigation and once you click on it the website becomes a giant slideshow that shows what the website has to offer. The navigation seems rather simple and is entirely based on how you click the mouse and where you hover over.<p>  
	  <p>The website its self has amazing graphics that the imagery looks clear and not pixilated. I love there are a wide variety of colors and the interactions the viewer has with the webpage. This website does a great job grasping the viewers attention and letting them surf the site which is why I choose it.<p>
