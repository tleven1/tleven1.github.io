      <h2><a href="http://www.vectorpark.com"> Vector Park<a></h2>
      <p>This website has an amazing sense of humor as well as great graphics which makes this site both entertaining and successful. When you first enter the site you get to pick from the different categories of what vector to play with. The concept is both innovative and fun making it a good fit for the websites theme. The navigation is easy to follow for any age and the mouse it what controls the entire site.<p>  
	  <p>The website its self seems to be meant for kids or for people who are bored and want to be entertained. I love the illustrations  and graphics because it makes the page more exciting. Each vector is different from one another and the pages are different as well.<p>
