      <p> Why I choose the website Draw a Stickman is because of its uniqueness and cool navigation.  When you first enter the website you as the view get to create your own personal stickman which makes it cool to see ur piece come to life.  The entire website requires you to continue to draw and create a story for your caracter. Though the site does not have a lot of graphic the ones that they do are amazing because they are your own. <p>
      <p> Learning how to use this navigational tool in future would amazing because I love the fact that website can be different every time you go on it.  The website is perfect for people who are bored and it makes viewer engaged in the content. After logging in to this site I realize how important it is to grasp the viewers attention.  They did an amazing job with this site. <p>
