      <p>This website has a great navigation as well as great graphics which makes this site both amusing and successful. When you first enter the site you get to pick from the different categories and when hovering over a section it flips and you are able to see a different image. This website is innovative in the way that it leads you trough the site. It is easy to follow for any age and once selecting  a section it highlighted and the rest of the sight is blurred.<p>  
	  <p>The website its self seems to be great for keeping things organized an simple. I love how simple it is and graphics because it makes the page more exciting. The loading symbol matches the boxes on the sight which also gives it a nice flow.<p>
